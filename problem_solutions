1. Beautiful Pretty Sexy
Description
A number k is beautiful if it is of the form 3n+1, is pretty if it is of the form 3n+2 and is sexy if it is of form 3n.
Given a number k, print if it is beautiful, pretty or sexy.


Solution:
k=int(input())
#check if the number is beautiful, pretty or sexy
if k%3==1:
    print('beautiful')
elif k%3==2:
    print('pretty')
elif k%3==0:
    print('sexy')


2. Alarm Clock
Description
You're trying to automate your alarm clock by writing a function for it. You're given a day of the week encoded as 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ... 6=Sat, 7=Sun, and whether you are on vacation as a boolean value (a boolean object is either True or False. Google "booleans python" to get a better understanding). Based on the day and whether you're on vacation, write a function that returns a time in form of a string indicating when the alarm clock should ring. 

When not on a vacation, on weekdays, the alarm should ring at "7:00" and on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) it should ring at "10:00". 

While on a vacation, it should ring at "10:00" on weekdays. On vacation, it should not ring on weekends, that is, it should return "off".

#Take input here
#we will take input using ast sys
import ast
input_str = input()

#ast.literal_eval() will evaluate the string and make a data structure for the same
#here the input is a list since input is in '[...]', so ast.literal_eval() will
#make a list with the same data as passed
input_list = ast.literal_eval(input_str)

#the data or the two values in list is now changed to separate variables
day_of_the_week = input_list[0] #first element is an integer denoting the day of the week
is_on_vacation = input_list[1] #this is a boolean denoting if its vacation or not

# write your code here
def alarm_clock(day_of_the_week,is_on_vacation):
    weekend=[6,7]
    if is_on_vacation:
        if day_of_the_week not in weekend:
            return '10:00'
        else :
            return "off"
    else:
        if day_of_the_week not in weekend:
            return '7:00'
        else :
            return '10:00'
            
print(day_of_the_week,is_on_vacation)
